## Insights from above Dashboard
### Top Sellers
- Revenue: Thai Chicken Pizza
- Quantity: Classic Deluxe Pizza
- Total Orders: Classic Deluxe Pizza
- The Classic Deluxe Pizza is the overall leader, generating the most total orders and the most quantity sold. However, the Thai Chicken Pizza brings in the highest revenue, suggesting it has a higher price point than the Classic Deluxe.

### Worst Sellers
- Revenue: Brie Carre Pizza
- Quantity: Soppressata Pizza (amongst those listed)
- Total Orders: Chicken Parm Pizza (amongst those listed)
- The Brie Carre Pizza performs poorly across all metrics, indicating it might not be as popular with customers. It's important to note that the data only shows the bottom 5 pizzas for quantity, so there could be pizzas selling even fewer slices than the Soppressata. Similarly, the Chicken Parm Pizza appears to be the least ordered pizza on the list.
